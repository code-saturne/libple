Installation
============

The installation system is based on the GNU autotools.

To create a standalone installation of PLE, it is recommended
to create a specific build directory, and run PLE's configure script
from there:

mkdir ple_build
cd ple_build
<path_to_ple_sources>/configure
make
make install

The "configure" script takes several options, so runnning:
<path_to_ple_sources>/configure --help
first is recommended to list the available options.
